# Image-Colourization-Using-GANs

Implemented an image colorization system using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The project involved converting grayscale images to colorized versions by training a GAN model with a U-Net architecture. The system was developed using TensorFlow/Keras, and included tasks such as dataset preparation, model training, and result visualization. Achieved effective colorization, demonstrating the potential of GANs in image processing applications.
